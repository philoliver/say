# Say!

A digital anonymous letterbox.

## What?

This is a small web application which collects one sentence posts. The posts are only accessible to those who have the password. Such a password could be announced in a company, for example. Think of it as a digital letter box where people can voice their opinion anonymously.

## Why?

This is a small toy project to practice Java and Spring. It is small enough to focus on the essential but big enough to be complete. It also has some tricky parts which are fun to think about :)

## How?
Clone the project. Do a maven install and run the `Application.java`.
If you want the subscription and email notifications to work edit the `application.properties` file.
